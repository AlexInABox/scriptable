# scriptable
Playing around with various scripts for the Scriptable app on iOS.

## TerminalWidget
Inspired by [evandcoleman](https://github.com/evandcoleman/scriptable), but re-written for my own data.

Currently, this widget shows information about:
- next calendar event
- next work calendar event
- weather
- location
- days until period start/end
- device stats (battery and screen brightness)

## DailyLogWidget
Customizable list of things and colors. Creates a new "log" for each day at 5 AM (time is also customizable for when you want a new day to start).

## Cache
Copied from [evandcoleman](https://github.com/evandcoleman/scriptable/blob/main/scripts/cache.js). This is used to cache values for the TerminalWidget (and others).
